This is important for several reasons:\n\n-   Allows you to assess potential financial impact at the state and district level\n-   Serves as a check to ensure that the intended student groups would be positively impacted or illustrate potential unintended consequences\n-   Can provide powerful data visualizations to illustrate the impact of the potential policy change\n\n## Before you start modeling your policy changes, make sure you clarify the problem you'd like to solve\n\n- In what _specific_ ways does current policy fall short?\n- Which policy options should be considered as alternatives?\n- How will you know if these alternative policies would be an improvement over current policy?\n- Do you have the right data to answer these questions?\n\n**Once you have clear answers to these questions, it's time to start modeling and assessing the impact of potential policy changes.**\n\n## Minnesota Example: Overview of compensatory revenue {.smaller}\n\nIn class 7, we went over the fundamentals and thought processes for building Minnesota's compensatory revenue formula, which is the state's funding stream for low-income students. Minnesota invests ~$551 million annually in compensatory revenue, which are state funds that are supposed to support the academic achievement of students who are not meeting state standards. There are three main policy issues with the current funding formula:\n\n-   Students who qualify for Reduced Price Lunch are weighted as 0.5.\n-   Schools where more than 80% of their students are in poverty do not see increases in per pupil compensatory revenue.\n-   The full base amount is not applied to the weight \n\n## Turning back to our questions: Are we ready to start modeling? {.smaller}\n\n- **In what _specific_ ways does current policy fall short?**\n    - Reduced price weight\n    - 80% cap \n    - The full per-pupil base isn't applied to the weight \n    \n- **Which policy options should be considered as alternatives?**\n    - Remove the cap\n    - Increase the reduced price weight from .5 to .75\n    - Do not subtract any fundign from the base \n    \n- **How will you know if these alternative policies would be an improvement over current policy?**\n    - More revenue going to the highest-poverty schools\n    \n- **Do you have the right data to answer these questions?**\n    - Yes!\n\n## Minnesota Example: Model current compensatory revenue funding stream\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# load -------\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nsource(\"mn_example/scripts/2_mn_comprev_data.R\")\n\n# Build Compensatory Revenue Formula ------\n\n# hard code in the variables \n\nreduced_weight <- 0.5\n\nfunding_cap <- 0.8\n\nweight_factor <- 0.6\n\nmn_pp_base <- 6567\n\nbase_subtractor <- 839\n\n##Calculate the compensatory revenue per school and rebuild the model\ncomprev_schools_model <- mn_comprev_final |>\n        #Step 1: Split the reduced price student count in half because they are only worth .5 in the compensatory revenue formula \n  mutate(comprev_reduced_count = reduced_lunch * reduced_weight, \n         #Step 2:Add together the .5 reduced price count to the free count to get the corrected frpl number for the compensatory revenue formula \n         comprev_frpl_reduced_total = comprev_reduced_count + free_lunch, \n         comprev_frpl_reduced_pct = comprev_frpl_reduced_total/enroll, #This is the new frpl % with .5 reduced price count\n         #Step 3: Divide by the weight factor by .8\n         comprev_weight_factor_step = comprev_frpl_reduced_pct/funding_cap, \n         ### I'm keeping this interim step so that I can track it\n         #Replace anything above 1 with 1 because of the formula \n         comprev_weight_factor = ifelse(comprev_weight_factor_step > 1, \n                                        1, comprev_weight_factor_step), \n         # determine the compensatory revenue pupil unit count \n         comprev_comp_pupil_unit = comprev_frpl_reduced_total* comprev_weight_factor* weight_factor , \n         # determine the amount of money that the school generates\n         comprev_total = comprev_comp_pupil_unit* (mn_pp_base - base_subtractor), \n         # per-pupil amount for the school that generates the funds \n         comprev_pp = comprev_total/frpl_total)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Scatterplot of the current compensatory revenue formula illustrates some of the issues\n\n![](mn_example/figures/plot1_current_comp_rev.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"8in\"}\n\n## Minnesota Example: Lifting the 80% cap on per-pupil funding {.smaller}\n\nThe 80% cap on per-pupil funding has a large impact on schools that serve 80% or more low-income students.

The overview should include descriptions of: \n\n- An overview of the policy problem \n- 2-3 policy changes you want to model \n- How you will know if the policy options would be an improvement over current policy\n- Data you will use to do your analysis \n\nSchedule at least one office hours session with Alex and Krista the week of August 14. As a reminder, capstone projects will be presented on **Tuesday, August 29 from 2:00 - 4:00 PM CST.**\n\n\n",
