    "text": "Why does education finance equity matter?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe longstanding and persistent reality is that vast funding inequities in our state public education systems render the education available to millions of American public school students profoundly unequal.”\n– U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, 2018\n\n\n\nSchool finance equity is a critical component of educational equity overall. In an equitable school finance system, schools would receive funds they need to provide a high-quality education for all students. School funding should be based on the needs of students, not the property wealth of individual communities or a checklist of programs.\nAcross the country, almost no states have fully achieved this goal.\nInequity in school finance holds back countless other efforts to improve educational outcomes. Achieving both adequacy (enough funding) and equity (funding distributed to where it is most needed) will not solve every educational problem, but it will enable more schools to provide their students with an excellent education."

    "text": "We are focused on inequities at the district level, where state laws shape funding distribution\nRelying on local property taxes to fund local schools (as most states do) ties school funding closely to housing and property wealth, fueling disparities in funding by race, ethnicity, and class — unless states act to balance the scales.\nProposals to address that challenge – changing structuring funding formulas to align with student needs rather than political clout – face huge barriers\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\nTaxable property wealth in Bridgeport, Connecticut, is equivalent to more than $500,000 per pupil.\nNeighboring Fairfield, Connecticut, has nearly $2 million in taxable property wealth per pupil.\nFor these communities to generate the same amount of per-pupil funding for their local public schools, Bridgeport would need to tax itself at a significantly higher rate than Fairfield. So lower wealth communities often pay taxes at a higher rate to generate less funds than their neighbors.\nAnd districts like Bridgeport with lower property wealth and higher-needs students rely on states to fill the gap. Which doesn’t always happen.\n\n\n\n\n."

Minnesota invests $551 million annually in compensatory revenue, which are state funds that are supposed to support the academic achievement of students who are not meeting state standards. There are three main policy issues with the current funding formula:\n\nStudents who qualify for Reduced Price Lunch are weighted as 0.5.\nSchools where more than 80% of their students are in poverty do not see increases in per pupil compensatory revenue.\nDistricts are allowed to keep 50% of the compensatory revenue funds and reallocate it as they see fit, which means that the schools that generate the funds only 50% of the dollars that are meant for their students. This takes away funding—and subsequently support—from the students who generate the dollars and need it the most."

This may require joining dataframes, pivot_longer(), pivot_wider() and/or using mutate() to merge, reshape, and tidy data from your state.\nUltimately, you’ll want to produce a single dataframe where:\n\nEach row represents a single LEA (traditional district or charter school)\nEach column represents a single variable\nAll of the data elements that go into your current formula are present in the dataframe.\n\nIf you need to join more than two dataframes, just start with joining two dataframes for this assingment. We can work on building the full dataset you’ll need to model your formula over the coming weeks.\nTo get started, a template R script is included: scripts/dist_clean.R – please use that file to load, clean, and save your tidy data.\nAs always, once you’ve completed the assignment, be sure to commit and push to GitHub!"

Property taxes are the most common source of local tax revenue for public schools in large part because they provide a stable revenue stream compared to taxes on sales or income. These taxes can be set by counties, towns, or school boards, depending on state policy.\nProperty taxes are typically collected based on two variables:\n\nAssessed value of property\nProperty tax rate, sometimes called the “mill” rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do property taxes produce education finance inequities?\nSchool districts generate revenue from the local property tax associated with property located within districts’ geographic boundaries. When school districts have significantly different levels of property wealth producing those tax revenues compared to one another, a massive barrier to equitable educational finance results.\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: NCES"

The assessed value of a property may not always match the market value. Some local governments use an assessment rate to translate the market value of a property into taxable value.\nWhat is the “property tax rate” or “mill rate?\nThe mill rate is the number of dollars per $1,000 in assessed value that property owners will owe each year. The mill rate multiplied by assessed value equals local property tax bills.\nIn some instances, state policy directly shapes or limits property taxes. Some states include caps on how much mill rates can grow each year; other states limit the growth in the assessed values of properties over time."

    "text": "Making Local School Funding More Equitable\nThe way school district boundaries are drawn and the way school funding formulas account for differences in tax capacity among districts can reflect, amplify, or mitigate property wealth inequality. State policymakers can also implement policies that directly address local funding inequity by constraining runaway local taxation by wealthier districts, compensating for local revenue differences with state funds, and/or redistributing some of those funds. Some examples include:\n\nCapping local revenue: State policymakers can set a limit on the amount of per-pupil revenue local communities can generate for their public schools.\nSupplementing local tax revenues in lower-wealth districts: States can provide additional funding to lower-wealth districts who choose to set a higher tax rate to ensure they get the same revenue for their tax effort that wealthier districts get.\nImplementing redistributive mechanisms for exceeding local revenue caps: If communities wish to generate more revenue for their local school system above the cap, policymakers can set a rule that for every additional dollar generated above the cap, another dollar must be allocated to a state fund for schools in lower-wealth communities.\nEnacting a statewide property tax: Moving from many locally collected taxes to a single, statewide property tax is the most direct way to address property wealth inequities among school districts. Vermont is the only state to implement a state-level property tax system for financing education."
